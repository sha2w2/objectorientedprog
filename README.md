<h1>Collatz Calculator Versions</h1>
<p>This repository contains different versions of my Collatz calculator.</p>
<h2>Version 1: 3xplus1.php</h2>
<p>This is the initial version of the calculator. It's a basic implementation.</p>
<h2>Version 2: 3x+1</h2>
<p>This version is more advanced and includes a user interface. It's located in the <code>3x+1</code> folder and consists of two files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>functions.php</code>: Contains the core calculation logic.</li>
  <li><code>mainform.php</code>: Provides a form for user input and displays the results.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>3x+1</code> version has more features than the <code>3xplus1.php</code> version.</p>
